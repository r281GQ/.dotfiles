# .dotfiles

## Installation

On a fresh system just navigate to the repo and download it as a `zip` file anywhere in the system.

Unzip the file and run the `install_packages.sh`. That will install the bare minimum dependencies on the system. After the script run you should be able to clone the repo into your home. From `~/` run `git clone git@github.com:r281GQ/.dotfiles.git`.

Now you have all the config files in your computer. Get into the folder by running `cd ~/.dotfiles` and run the `config.sh` script, which will guide you through the steps.
